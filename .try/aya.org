** example 1
   count_of_~red = get_total("~red");
   count_of_red = get_total("red");
   count_of_2 = get_total("2");
   count_of_343 = get_total("343");

   $fred = makefile($fred) ;
   $fred = makefile($fred) ;
   $q = makefile($q) ;
   $3 = makefile($3) ;
   $eew = makefile($eew) ;

   multiline examples
   are OK
   here is another example

   multiline fud
   are OK
   here is another pud

   multiline parameters
   are OK
   here is another parameter (typed in separately)

*** one-line
    field$ = document.getElementById("");
    field = document.getElementById("");

    field2ds = document.getElementById("2ds");

    fieldee = document.getElementById("ee");

*** the template placeholders don't have to be 'real'
    field(~this) = field(~that)
    this and that are just placeholder names tot actual parameters to
    functions

    field(this) = field(that)
    would delete this line now unless it remains meaningful

        field(THIS) = field(THAT)
    field(A) = field(B)
    field(C) = field(D)

    field(a) = field(d)
    field(dd) = field()
    field(q) = field(d)
    field(d) = field(dd)
eee
dddd
    field(q) = field(s)


    

*** 3
    when parameter A is replaced with B
    then C becomes A and B becomes C

    when parameter ~A is replaced with ~B
    then ~C becomes ~A and ~B becomes ~C
    
    when parameter A is replaced with B
    then C becomes A and B becomes C
    
    when parameter Arlo is replaced with Bob
    then Carl becomes Arlo and Bob becomes Carl

** useful?
   would say it's a feature that comes in handy in particular circumstances
   but most of the time it would require good facility to instinctively
   use it and not a manual repetition using copy/yank OR a heavier method
   using elisp, kmacro, yasnippet, or external method
