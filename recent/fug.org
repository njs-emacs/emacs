* intro
   fug-mode is inspired by an emacs-rock video which introduced
   restclient-mode, a mode which allows a set of requests to be prepared
   in a buffer and passed to a server on request
   In fug-mode each request line consists of an expression which
   defines a debugger command and other parameters for example
   a key binding specification
   When fug-electric-mode is active single keys activate fug commands
   Otherwise the C-c prefix is used, and normal editing is enabled
