as of 111104-192932 I don't know if the below is still true
SHELL is set to cmdproxy.exe and bash seems to run fine
we use ESHELL (fallback to SHELL) environment variable
so here we see we actually mean either ESHELL must be set
to bash (which it currently is) or SHELL must be (which
it currently isn't
---- old text follows ---

HOME environment var must be set for bash to work
SHELL env var must be set to bash.exe
don't have command line -l option if $HOME/.emacs exists
